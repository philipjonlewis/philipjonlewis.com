            With over six years of experience in the Architecture, Engineering
            and Construction (AEC) industry, I have honed my ability to analyze
            and solve complex problems.

            My proficiency in software engineering has enabled me to build

            {' '}
            As a licensed architect, I have effectively managed the design and
            production of multiple projects, excelling in client presentations
            and coordination with engineers and suppliers.

          <p>
            My primary tech stack is MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node
            with TypeScript) and I am comfortable working within the
            TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem. I am always eager to further my
            growth as a multi-disciplinary developer and team player, and I am
            currently self-studying advanced coding topics and exploring
            blockchain and mobile app development. If you&apos;re looking for a
            dedicated and talented developer, look no further than me.
